\caption{Modified means and standard deviations based sensitivity
ranking of reaction rates with respect to the total thrombin using
``Morris one at a time'' method. Horizontal axis shows reaction
rates. Vertical axis shows modified means and standard deviations
respectively. This figure indicates  that $k_{14}$ has the largest
modified mean and standard deviation,  and that $k_{14}$ is the most
sensitive to variance of total thrombin. } \label{Fig:mmean}

\caption{Modified Morris diagram on sensitivity ranking of reaction
rates with respect to the total thrombin. Ranks of sensitivity for
individual reaction rates are determined by their distance from the
origin. From this figure, the five most sensitive reaction rates are
$k_{14}$, $k_{15}$,  $k_{11}$, $k_{9}$ and $k_{37}$. The other
reaction rates cluster together due to the same magnitude of
sensitivity. } \label{Fig:std}
